The `Place` model represents a place in the application. It includes attributes such as `title`, `description`, `price`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `owner`. It also includes methods to add reviews and amenities.

### Review

The `Review` model represents a review in the application. It includes attributes such as `text`, `rating`, `user`, and `place`.

### Amenitie

The `Amenitie` model represents an amenity in the application. It includes an attribute `name`.

### BaseModel

The `BaseModel` class provides common attributes and methods for all models, such as `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Testing
